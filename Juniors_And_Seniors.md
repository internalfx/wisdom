# Juniors and Seniors
This document is not specific to JavaScript, web development, or even software until specifically stated otherwise. The concepts and observations mentioned in this document apply to any profession.

## TLDR;
The difference between juniors and seniors is the direction from which a problem is solved. Juniors start at the self and move toward the goal. Seniors work in the opposite direction.

## Confidence
Ultimately the difference between junior and senior practitioners of a given career comes down to a single word: [confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence) which is merely trust in a given hypothesis or plan.  The term *confidence* must not be confused with [arrogance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris), which is more or less externalized demands of [reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)) as opposed to confidence which is frequently innately internalized and not communicated.

A person achieves confidence through frequent practice that results in a measurable outcome such that a person discerns either success or failure from their contribution.  The positivity of that outcome, a failure compared to a success, lacks significance so long as the person appropriately recognizes the outcome achieves either success or failure.  The appreciation of that outcome, whether positive or negative, results in learning that influences future attempts.  The frequency of such practice dictates the clarity of learning as learning through trial and error lacks an immediately identifiable connection between the variables that comprise an attempt that the resultant outcome.

## False Confidence
False confidence, which may comprise [the planning fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy), occurs due to trust generated from expediency opposed to experience or when trust is applied from experience that does not match a current context.  The Planning fallacy suggests that when there exists a disconnect between confidence and the outcome of a proposal, as identified in hindsight, that difference presents a bias in favor of optimism. Identifying false confidence presents a great challenge since it is most readily visible only after a failure is compared against the confidence placed in the attempted solution.  Tools to combat false confidence include:

* Tests
* Models
* Historical artifacts
* Risk Analysis
* Competing Proposals

## Planning
The best way to defend against false confidence is through continuous planning.

> I tell this story to illustrate the truth of the statement I heard long ago in the Army: Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction because when you are planning for an emergency you must start with this one thing: the very definition of “emergency” is that it is unexpected, therefore it is not going to happen the way you are planning.
>
> So, the first thing you do is to take all the plans off the top shelf and throw them out the window and start once more. But if you haven't been planning you can't start to work, intelligently at least.
>
> That is the reason it is so important to plan, to keep yourselves steeped in the character of the problem that you may one day be called upon to solve - or to help solve.

> Be well prepared and brief in your remarks. There is positively no excuse for wasting another's time by going to the meeting unprepared and rambling helplessly in your talk. Remember, if you fail to prepare, you are preparing to fail.

Planning separates an experienced senior from a junior more than any other single activity. While planning occurs more regularly among seniors and with greater ease the greatest challenge for seniors comprises communicating an appreciation for the need to plan.

## Process Inversion
Frequent planning allows a freedom of execution otherwise not available, which occurs due to process inversion.

### Typical Process for a Junior
The following steps roughly describe the natural process that guide juniors through a work effort.

1. Process starts through gathering familiar tools.
1. Upon collection of the familiar tools they must discern how those tools work together ([composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(objects))), which allows a standard process or [boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_text).
1. Analysis of a work statement or problem occurs.
1. Search for a recipe or formal instructions occurs.
1. Gathering of additional tools or ingredients not known prior to the problem analysis occurs.
1. Work commences following patterns addressed in the collected recipe/instructions or familiar to instructed guidance.
1. Execution completes and testing occurs.
1. Work delivery to the product owner determines process completion.
1. Optionally leadership requires [Postmortem documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation).

### Typical Process for a Senior
Compare the junior work process to the work process of an experienced senior.

1. Process starts with receipt of a work statement or problem.
1. Analysis occurs to formalize technical requirements in writing.
1. The senior generates a tentative execution plan which lists required components.
1. Decisions formalize to determine which required components become dependencies.
1. Gathering and/or creating components occurs in isolation informally addressing [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). The term *separation of concerns* typically exists as a computer science specific term, but the concept bears equal importance to a variety of logistic and financial concerns.
1. The senior writes instructions that composes the required components as necessary to achieve the execution plan. Those instructions typically present as some combination of work artifacts and formal documentation.
1. The senior conducts tests.
1. The senior delivers the work.

In the case of the junior developer the work process starts at the self and moves away from the self toward the end state gradually with each step while the opposite occurs for the seasoned senior. The most likely explanation for the difference of behavior and process flow occurs due to confidence, or more specifically the experience to form hasty plans and better anticipate risk. That transformation from the junior process to the senior process occurs gradually as a form of maturity resulting from the slow increase of confidence. Although risk and planning may account for how the senior workflow differs it does not account for motivation.

## Flexibility
High confidence and continuous planning allow practitioners increased flexibility to accomplish a work product. [Flexibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexibility_(engineering)), which means adapt to change or navigate around challenges, most frequently suggests simultaneously forming and weighing multiple competing approaches to a problem, known as [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)). Should changes occur that invalidate a proposed execution plan a secondary execution plan already in place reduces lost time and effort. Flexibility becomes more readily achievable when a given work process accounts for planning as early as possible in the process.

## Expert Beginner
There exists a new concept of *expert beginners*. Junior developers, as exemplified above, prioritize their needs first and gradually work towards the problem. Think of expert beginners as highly seasoned juniors in that they demonstrate mastery of popular tools but they never reach process inversion and learn to work backwards from a problem to a solution. Expert beginners never develop the flexibility to solve tough problems outside their comfort area and remain confined to the capabilities of their favorite tool(s). The second order consequence to that missing flexibility demonstrates as a fear of originality.

## Dependencies
Perception of dependencies comprise a major differentiator between juniors and seniors. Seniors, due to their experience, offer a more balanced approach to the evaluation of dependencies, specifically whether to include some external tool or produce a new original tool. See this [video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cTq0E7gZMA) where actor Tommy Lee Jones describes musician Marco Beltrami creating original musical instruments to achieve certain unique sounds for film scores.

Juniors frequently evaluate dependencies in proximity to their personal comfort as determined by perceived work effort and distance from familiarity. In some careers juniors react with terror to the thought of producing original work components and demonize others that do, see [Invented Here Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invented_here). Perhaps the most common qualifier for that behavior consists of some form of community vetting wherein a work component comprises fewer problems when more popular. Security research suggests ignoring community vetting as a point of evaluation because even popular work components comprise severe defects and the more popular such work components become to end users the more popular they become to malicious parties looking to attack those end users, which may violate [duty of care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care) and [due diligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence).

Seniors tend to evaluate dependencies with regard to maintenance expense beyond initial configuration and portability.

### Maintenance
The cost of support, the speed of defect resolution, additional purchases or licensing fees, and learning time all comprise maintenance expenses. In many cases it costs less to build your own tool, especially if you supply the defect resolution and cannot wait for or afford third party support.

If a tool requires extended learning time to operate or extend that time must qualify as an expense. In many cases it may take an equivalent period of time for a senior to produce a new tool that does not require such learning. That sames time from that senior and also saves time for other people in that senior's organization.

### Portability
The size of a component, the time required to configure it, the expense to migrate away from it, and the cost of utility assets (other supporting dependencies, water, electricity, licensed technicians) all comprise portability. In many cases it makes more sense to internally develop new tools that address these concerns as cost saving measures with the potential for external sales/licensing as additional streams of revenue.
