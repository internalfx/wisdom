# 10x Developer
There is a something whispered in programming called the *10x developer*.  That guy that out performs their peers by an order of magnitude.  This document is a manual to become that developer and achieve greater output.

## Productivity
Productivity is accomplishing a given task in shorter time, which then allows for improved *[efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency)* which means greater quantity of task completion comparable to equivalent time from another developer.  This document is more about efficiency than productivity, but improvements to efficiency can only be attained by either task elimination and/or increases to productivity.

Efficiency is an economic term that can be applied to any task or action.  This means the solution to increased efficiency is more about thinking in terms of economic gains than technology preferences.  As such, for any given decision, do not think in terms of what action takes less time to accomplish now, but instead what takes less total time knowing such decisions will be revisited many times.

## Virtues
The spiritual path of increased efficiency is a matter of deliberate effort.

### Be Simple
Simplicity means *fewer*.  Don't over think that.  It doesn't mean easy.  Conversely, simple often takes increased effort which makes it noticeably less easy.  For example it takes less effort, and time, to write a unique solution for a variety of similar problems.  With a bit of extra time and effort a single solution to those related problems will likely result in less maintenance and low a lower cost to scale a given solution.  For a deeper dive into simplicity see [elegance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegance), and [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology), and [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

With simplicity there are fewer options to choose from, which results in a clearer path forward.  That lowers cognitive fatigue and allows for rapid planning.  It also means there is less to break, less to fix, and less to test.

Avoid *[polyinstantiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyinstantiation)*.  When there is a single instance of a given piece of logic there is a single thing to troubleshoot.  Polyinstantiation allows many instances of a thing, which is the opposite of simple.  To make many is to *[complicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity)*.

### Be Wrong
An incorrect decision at present is more valuable than a future correct decision due to lost time.  That doesn't mean to make decisions blindly without forethought or planning.  Instead, form a hasty incomplete assessment of the problem and begin taking action early.  While taking initial action be planning the end state and challenging the early hasty approach.

This path is important for one key reason: *[learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning)*.  A problem appears one way from the outside, but through deeper diving and peeling back layers the problem at hand may be something utterly different and/or may present second order consequences otherwise unknown.  Time spent learning through an initial hasty attempted solution frequently allows discovery of simplicity opportunities.

A simplicity opportunity is a discovery where a complexity of requirements can be solved with a single solution.  The action to change existing code to apply simplicity is called *refactoring*.  Routinely avoiding simplicity opportunities increases complexity by addition of new code, which is a forced [dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy).

### Be Iterative
When a developer iterates ten times faster they may fail nine times more often without consequence or loss of efficiency, which means nine times greater learning of a given problem before a lose of efficiency.  Time of iteration means the delay it takes to make a code change, build/compile/execute that code, test the change, and evaluate the result.

### Be Clear
Programming is writing.  Segment logic into related areas of logical separation.  People have to read and reason about programming as a written artifact.

Programming is not a novel.  Do not leave a reader hanging in suspense.  Writing is a tool before it has any value in entertainment.  Likewise, programming is a written tool.

The most important quality of literacy in programming is [control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow), which is the logical progression and order of instructions through the execution of an application.  Be clear and purposeful in writing code that articulates the control flow.  Do not hope that syntax or clever conventions will somehow solve for this or provide enhanced clarity.  Remember that efficiency is an economics term and in economics there is *[no free lunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch)*.  For example many developers find asynchronous control flow challenging to reason about and callbacks distressing to read.  A convenient short hand alternative to callbacks are asynchronous functions and the *await* keyword.  The async/await approach requires syntax callbacks do not and requires fewer characters to write, but they solve for the same problem.  A serious disadvantage to that more convenient approach is that the solution is separated from its problem in the code which complicates the reading and following of control flow logic through the course of the application.

Upon discovery of barriers and limitations annotate such roadblocks in writing.  Keep moving forward elsewhere as a roadblock is not an excuse to stop working.  Be thinking about that roadblock while doing other work and perhaps a creative circumvention will come to mind.

### Be Independent
Know the problem at hand.  If the problem isn't clearly understood a given solution isn't limited to what it appears to be.  Many developers believe a given tool or framework is necessary to do their jobs for them, which makes those developers fully obsolete as the given tool becomes unnecessary or unwanted.  Additional layers of software create complexity, also known as the [law of leaky abstractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction).  That additional complexity touches all aspects of iteration.

Think of independence as portability.  If a bunch of tools, a high speed internet connection, a large build task, a bunch of libraries, and a bunch of processes are required to program anything efficiency is hopeless dependent upon the speed and availability of each of those things.  If instead writing an application, at least getting it started, by simply opening a web browser and typing into the developer tools console there are far fewer limitations.  In this case nothing is in the way preventing productivity.

I can remember a decade ago when a software library called jQuery was all the rage.  Developers claimed to be so much more efficient thanks to jQuery, however if that library was missing or unavailable many of those developers couldn't write code at all.  That is not efficient.  Worse is that many of those developers could not debug the code they wrote with that library.

### Be Direct
Do not spend time on pleasantries or decoration.  Know the path forward and achieve the solution without distraction.  In practice this mostly means avoiding unnecessary bullshit.  If there is a common standard to solve for a given problem then code directly to that standard.  Many developers intentionally ignore standards they perceive as low level out of concern for vanity or insecurity.

### Be Honest
Do that which serves efficiency most well.  According to [Nichomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics) that which exists for its own sake is of higher virtue than that which exists for the sake of another.  First, be direct and honest of your own goals and intentions.  Do not attempt to accomplish one thing hoping it will provide something else.  If you cannot be honest to yourself you cannot hope to be honest to others.

### Be Specific
Do not save keystrokes on implied or assumed logic.  Specificity requires focus and discipline as the opposite of specificity is laziness or [avolition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avolition).

### Be Helpful
Provide documentation.  Automate that documentation as much as possible to avoid incorrect or out of date artifacts.  A written guide is helpful to yourself as well as others.

### Be Transparent
Openly admit where your code fails.  Accept blame openly.  Solve for failures quickly.  Do not waste peoples' time with excuses and posturing.  Do not waste time avoiding writing code in vane hope somebody will write your solution for you or that some tool exists to do your job.  Nobody feels sorry for you, but everyone genuinely respects integrity.

Do not accept blame or failure for a system outside your ownership and contribution.  If there is a failure be clear about the nature of the failure and seek resolution without regard for blame.
