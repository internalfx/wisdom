# Avoiding Trolls
Trolls, in the context of online personas, are people who engage in conversations seeking to destroy or suppress an opposing point of view or harass people.  These personalities are often corrosive and divisive.  Any attempt to engage a troll feeds the attention they seek even if the resulting conversation displays their foolishness.  They cannot be defeated, but they can be ignored.  Any attempt to challenge a troll validates their behavior and enables additional toxic behaviors.

## Identifying Trolls
### Contests
Please say this out loud: **A conversation is not a contest!**

If a person enters a conversation with a goal to win as though there is a contest or battle the person is a troll.  Simply do not engage this person.  They will do everything to provoke a fight.  They only lose if you do not give them the fight they seek.  You on the other hand can only lose or walk away.  Engaging this form of troll often dissolves the conversation into a toxic holy war, which is a conversation whose participants will fight exhaustively over an excruciatingly trivial subject.

### Distraction
Sometimes a person will intentionally seek to distract you away from the conversation at hand.  This is called [baiting](#baiting).  This typically occurs when a challenging opinion is contributed to somebody in disagreement who doesn't have a valid or credible response but still wishes to *win*, *distract*, or *terminate* the conversation.  Any attempt to suppress or discredit an opposing point of view might be trolling.

### Tag Team
Sometimes trolling is a team action.  Misery loves company and in the case of apparent insecurity it will band together into teams of trolls who feel compelled to not just *win a conversation* but permanently banish an enemy challenger.  Conversations don't have enemies or winners/losers.  When this kind of toxic community is encountered kindly take their punishment respectfully or simply leave.  A toxic community will not make you wiser or happier but may certainly make you more depressed or less respectful.  See [echo chamber](#echo-chamber) for more details.

### Voting and Popularity
Some communities, for example [Reddit](http://reddit.com/), allow voting.  The result of that voting is immediately available to everybody.  Opinions aren't more or less valid because the community votes in a particular way.  This form of consensus authority quickly produces [echo chambers](#echo-chambers), which comprise a group of like-minded individuals acting in a team capacity to moderate the content of an opinion.  An opinion isn't more correct merely because it receives more *up votes* than another opinion.  Likewise, an opinion isn't necessarily more wrong merely because it receives down votes or is negatively scored.

Say this out loud: **A conversation is not a contest!**.

A lack of popularity certainly **is not** trolling, but an attacking or competitive person will use any evidence of supremacy at their disposal to qualify winning or losing.  Remember, **a conversation is not a contest**.  Identifying a person, or opinion, as trolling is an attack on a person's character, which is a form of [ad hominem](#ad-hominem) attack.  This is particularly true if such an attack is used to turn a conversation into a battle.

---

In the end if you aren't seeking to become challenged, wiser, or respectful to the people around you then you are likely a troll.  If you are easily offended or exceedingly defensive you are likely a troll.  If a conversation is a contest or ever feel that a good offense makes for a strong defense you are a troll.  If your behavior reflects team participation or indicates any form of popularity as validation of any opinion you are a troll.

Don't become a troll.

---

## Not Trolls
### Challenging People
People who provide challenging opinions are not trolling so long as they are not deviating from the conversation at hand.  There are some people whose only goal is to attain emotional harmony.  When a challenging opinion is encountered it is easy for some people to view this disruption to the social norm as trolling, when it likely isn't.  **A person isn't doing anything wrong for having a difference of opinion.**  If any stated opinion alters your emotional state or provokes you to retaliate you should ignore that opinion.  If you do retaliate then you are likely the troll.  See the next section on *Causing Sadness* for more information.

### Causing Sadness
Some people are easily offended.  For example the mere mention of topics like *net neutrality*, *white supremacy*, or *global warming* is enough to incite bitter emotion in people.  When a person engages in a conversation directly without distraction they aren't trolling simply because you became emotional.  A person's fragile emotional state is not evidence of trolling.  More directly, **your sadness is not my problem**.

If you, in your deep state of sadness and offense, respond to a person with an attack or seek to distract the person from the conversation at hand then you are a troll.  People are allowed to disagree with you no matter how sad you become.  Again, **your sadness is not my problem**.

### Ignorance
A person with a poor understanding of a conversation's subject or material isn't trolling if they make a false point out of ignorance.  It is possible they simply didn't know.  Kindly and politely provide the individual with links to educational material.  It is up to that individual if they choose to accept or consume the contents of that material.  Even after educational material is offered the other person may still remain ignorant of have a differing opinion, which is perfectly fine.

The most negative quality associated with ignorance is the associated second and third order consequences.  Faulty conclusions drawn from the absence of appropriate evidence can sometimes take on a life of their own that results in new conversations and wild tangents, but these new wonderful thought experiments are sweet fruit of a poisonous tree.  

Even after this ignorance is clearly demonstrated in a conversation that has long since gone off track people may not choose to deviate from a the preferred ignorant path.  It is acceptable to kindly demonstrate the ignorance by presented strong evidence, but it is not acceptable to force a correction of police the conversation.

When you attempt to police the opinions of other people or force opinions upon people you become the troll.  If a difference of opinion, no matter how ignorant or uninformed, results in an attack from you then you are a troll.  **People are allowed to disagree with you.**

### Stupidity
Sometimes there is a discernable difference between ignorance and stupidity.  Ignorance suggests a decision created with the absence of knowledge, perhaps universally common knowledge.  Stupidity, on the other hand, suggests a decision that violates logic or accepted term definitions where missing knowledge is not a factor.  Stupidity is not necessarily trolling so long as the commentary is entirely within the subject of the current conversation without intention to attack or bait another person into attack.

Stupidity is commonly demonstrated by people who confuse unrelated concepts, fail to follow a chain of events in a conversation, or who suggest logical fallacies. Here is a thorough list of [logical fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies).

Perhaps the most generally confused, or intermingled, things are science, faith, and politics.  Typically stupidity occurs due to a lack of objectivity and a need to achieve validation without the effort to achieve the necessary qualifiers.  Sometimes stupidity is an intentional effort to exercise a wide influence campaign among an audience that needs any excuse to qualify their own internal belief systems.

Science comes in only two flavors: research and experiments.  Science exists to create new knowledge objectively from data using the scientific method and nothing else qualifies as science.  Therefore your belief systems (bias) or concern for the popularity of a thing (politics) are not science.  A common example of science is research on global warming.  This research is science that achieves viability and acceptance through peer review.  The critical examination of global warming to challenge accepted research is also science.  **Viable science is always open to reproducibility and challenge.**  Scientific research can be discredited by additional science that demonstrates contrary conclusions.  The popularity of global warming is *politics*.  The belief in global warming is *faith*.

Let's clear up the term *theory*.  Scientifically speaking a theory is a well reasoned guess.  A theory can be qualified with evidence and research, but a theory cannot be definitively proven, scientifically speaking.  The more supporting evidence qualifying a theory allows the theory to achieve a higher degree of acceptance, *politics*.  However, a theory can be disproven.  Science is objective, so this criteria does not mean theories are false or weak.  They simply are logically valid or invalid and either present or disproven.  Opinions upon theories not qualified with evidence or research are often examples of *faith* systems.

Politics comes in only three flavors: policy decisions, popularity, and influence.  Politics is not research or the gathering of data (science), but rather the use of that data to influence people or shift popularity of a subject.  A common example where this is confused is the scientific consensus of human caused global warming.  There is a large amount of science to suggest humans are contributing to global warming on Earth and perhaps greater than 90% of sciences who study such things are in agreement to that conclusion.  The statistics that comprised that 90% number could be gathered as a form of scientific research, but the consensus itself is politics that has no bearing on the objectivity or viability of the global warming scientific research.  This *popularity has no bearing on the practice of the scientific method*, but it does influence funding for further research and policy decisions.

Faith is any system of belief, which may include religion, but is not limited to religion.  All people demonstrate faith in some form as belief systems are an innate component of basic decision formulation regardless of any religious affiliation.  Many people believe human activity is contributing to global warming, which is faith and not science.  Although this opinion may be based upon collections of scientific research it is still faith and not science.  Science comes in only two flavors: research and experimentation.  Often politics, such as popularity or lack thereof, and social reference groups will influence a person's belief systems.  Belief in global warming is not science.  A change in belief does not make the science more or less valid.  **The depth and devotion to any belief is not an indication of scientific relevance on any subject.**

Stupidity is often, though not always, an unintentional form of self-deception.  This means a person is attempting to fool themselves with a misuse of terminology to better qualify their position on an argument and then pass that qualification off to others as a reasoned validation.  For example referring to a position as *scientific* sounds more qualified than *personal opinion* and for some people it simply feels good to think of themselves as some form of expert, such as a *scientist*.  **The strength of a position stands on its own merits without the clumsiness of these faulty elaborations and actual practicing experts readily see the difference.**

Stupidity is common and is not necessarily trolling.  It is accepted behavior to kindly and politely demonstrate how a contribution qualifies as stupidity by providing definitions of terms or research. Sometimes challenges of stupidity are greeted by [hurt feelings](#hurt-feelings), particularly if the stupidity is essential to a deeply held belief system.  **Do not use another person's hurt feelings as an attempt to troll bait.**  Be the better person, conclude the conversation, and walk away.

### Tough Questions
A person certainly isn't a troll for asking challenging questions.  Merely because a question destroys the fragility of your deeply held opinion does not mean a person is trolling.  [John Stuart Mill](http://www.bartleby.com/130/2.html) once said truth is the result of a collision of opposing points of view.  If you are incapable of accepting this without attacks or distraction you are a troll.

A person's behavior dictates whether or not they are a troll opposed to the content of their opinion.

## Avoid Becoming a Troll
When a user engages the negativity of a troll the troll wins.  The troll achieves desired attention, even if negative.  Do not allow a troll to bring you down to their level.  Always maintain the moral high ground, which is most often achieved by simply ignoring the troll or abandoning a conversation that has turned toxic.

Avoid calling out a person as a troll.  This is, even when well intended with evidence, a form of ad hominem attack.  Attacking people in any way, such as labeling people (even if warranted by their negative conduct), is itself a form of trolling.  Don't attack people.

When trolling becomes clear the best action is to walk away.  Sometimes trolling behavior isn't immediately clear.  In the case where trolling is hard to identify the best response is a **one word answer**.  The response is to a one word answer is typically enough to identify the other person's motives.  As an example when a person asks you to present evidence that you do not have simply respond with: "*No.*".  Do not elaborate in any way.

**Always be polite and respectful**, even if you are being attacked my multiple people.  The goal of a troll is to shatter your humility and self-confidence so as to attain the attention they crave.  Simply do not give into the pressure by always maintain a respectful and polite tone.

Perhaps the most challenging aspect for a well intended online citizen is to avoid baiting.  Always be vigilant and watchful that a response to a conversation is a form of distraction.  **Always keep within the field of the current conversation.**  Never respond to somebody seeking to distract you from the conversation and don't allow yourself to become distracted.

## Types of Trolling Behaviors
### Ad Hominem
A personal attack against yourself or personal character.  This is the most primitive and possibly the most common form of trolling.  This typically occurs when a person in a conversation becomes emotional and has exhausted all rational responses and yet feels the need to continue conversing in the only way they know how.

One dubious form of ad hominem is to jump straight to calling you a troll when there is no evidence of negative behavior.  This can occur if an attacking person disapproves of the communication at hand and needs to deflect their negativity directly at you when they can no longer argue the subject at hand.  This form of attack frequently occurs in [echo chambers](#echo-chamber).

#### Best Course of Action
The best course of action is to immediately terminate the conversation by not replying to or engaging the troll in any way.  If a moderator is available alert the moderation of the trolling the evidence of the bad behavior.  Regardless of whether a moderator takes any action you are done.

#### Worst Course of Action
The worst course of attack is to attack the troll, because now you are a troll as well.  They have succeeded in bring you down to their level.  If a moderator is actively present they should ban both of you.

---

### Baiting
Baiting is a form of response intended to cause offense and provoke a response without becoming an ad hominem attack.  A common example of baiting is instead of attacking you the troll attacks the nature of your commentary.  In either case the troll is seeking unwelcome attention by leaving the field of conversation.

#### Best Course of Action
Same as above for ad hominem attack.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any response at all.**  An ad hominem attack could be a rational person simply becoming frustrated and irrational.  Troll baiting is intentional.  Any response to the baiting feeds the troll and damages your character.

---

### Citation Baiting
When a conversation decays into something political a person may challenge you for evidence or a citation.  Sometimes this makes sense and elevates the conversation into greater depth and precision.  Often, though, the request for evidence occurs because a person is lazy and either cannot find the energy to do their own research or because they are using a clever form of [troll baiting](#baiting).

There are some cases a request for evidence can arise that simply don't make any sense.  Questions or challenge to asserted theories do not ever require evidence.  This bad faith request is called [sea lioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning).  Sometimes this toxic behavior is intentional and other times the requestor is simply too ignorant to understand the difference.

A common example of unintentional citation baiting is a rhetorical question begging clarification.  If a person were sincerely asking for additional information their question would clearly reflect this.  Sometimes people will ask a question without any desire for the question to be answered in a manner they might incorrectly perceive as Socratic dialogue.  All such questions are trolling hoping for you to defensively perform research they should have performed themselves.  Answer all such questions with *I don't know* and immediately abandon the conversation.

#### Best Course of Action
If you already have the requested evidence at hand, immediately know where to find it, or are simply curious yourself then be a kind and helpful person by quickly presenting the requested evidence.

In other cases simply respond with "*No*".  Don't do their research for them.  If this kills the current conversation at hand then so be it.  If the requesting person were really interested in the conversation they would find that evidence themselves or ask for help in finding it.  Any elaboration greater than a response of "*No*" feeds the troll and encourages additional troll attacks.

#### Worse Course of Action
If a request for evidence is completely irrational to the current conversation the requesting person is likely troll baiting.  The same details apply as for troll baiting.

---

### Echo Chamber
Echo Chambers are a community of trolls who come together to attack any contributions that challenges the group opinion like white blood cells protecting the body.  This is a natural occurrence that happens when online communities swell to massive sizes and moderation is not aggressive in controlling for it.  The toxic nature of an echo chamber is commonly referred to offline as *heckling*.

A highly insecure community may view any challenge to their value system as deliberate trolling, which is certainly not trolling.  This behavior is a mistaken form of social [social gadfly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_gadfly) where the status quo is certainly challenged but directly so fully within the context of the current conversation without intended disruption.

Like other forms of trolling the goal is negative attention.  Unlike other forms of trolling many of the participants, sometimes called *sheep*, are not aware that they are trolling.  The common motivation for echo chamber trolling is to ensure a contributor of communications that challenge a group's value consensus, often personal insecurities, feels so punished that they are isolated and hopefully leave forever.  Its a team strategy to punish a person for the content of their message opposed to their behavior.  Echo chambers could be the unintended byproduct of [narcissistic supply](#narcissistic-supply).

#### Best Course of Action
Simply take the punishment as devout act of humility, but **absolutely do not under any circumstances change your opinion to that of the group consensus**.  Changing your opinion to the group's desired opinion reaffirms and enables their bad behavior.  You aren't wrong for having a difference of opinion.

An echo chamber is a form of moderation where the participants aren't likely moderators but feel the need to police conversations using trolling techniques in a team capacity.  Any rebuttal will feed the negativity and ignorance of persons intentionally trolling and may turn unintentional trolls into intentional trolls.

#### Worst Course of Action
Engaging the trolls is a bad mistake, but in this case isn't the worst thing either.  The worst course of action to is to cave to the group pressure and affirm their toxic values.  Instead remain forever polite, stand affirm with your opinion, and humbly accept the group punishment that results.

---

### Narcissistic Supply
A personality who seeks to build a cult-like following for their own self-satisfaction, often as a status symbol or for self focused positive commentary.  While the cause of the problem is a single, or few, key toxic personalities the result, if they are successful, is a toxically corrupt community.

#### Best Course of Action
**Abandon the community.**  It is essentially an [echo chamber](#echo-chamber) on steroids intentionally built, directed, and reenforced by toxic leader.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any form of engagement.**  Every form of action with this type of community is a worst case scenario.

---

### Social Justice Warrior
A social justice warrior is a fierce warrior seeking to do battle to right the social ills plaguing the world.  Essentially, social justice warriors inject politics into non-political venues.  While this motivation and subject may certainly be noble it often has no place in many online communities and is often perceived as a horrid pest.  Worse still, is that this form of pest is honestly convinced of their ultimate righteouness to such an extent that any criticism of their behavior is met with a deep and profound sense of victimization.  It is common for this victimization to be the basis and ammunition for an attack, such that it may appear to be a counter-attack to a prior attack that never existed.

Since social justice warriors may quickly view themselves as victims of every crime and offense they may view themselves in the same position as an echo chamber victim.  The primary difference between a social justice warrior and an [echo chamber](#echo-chamber) victim is that a social justice warrior is focused on subjects completely outside the scope of the community.  There is also a difference of numbers.  An echo chamber victim is a single person, or a small few, attacked by a great many while a social justice warrior may invite others to their fight thereby becoming the very echo chamber their behaviors and words suggest they are victims of.

The unique challenge posed by social justice warriors is that they are not at war with just a single person.  They are at war with the entire community and possibly the world.  A typical troll focused on trolling a single person, or select few people, can be easily managed by simply ignoring them until they go away.  The problem with the social justice warriors is that to defeat this kind of troll everybody in the community must ignore them until they go away, which is unlikely at best.

If a person wishes to be a social justice warrior they should volunteer at a community organization or become a lawyer, but they certainly shouldn't pollute online coversations with their political nonsense.  If this statement results in offense or confusion please read about [stupidity](#stupidity) and [hurt feelings](#hurt-feelings).

#### Best Course of Action
Report the toxic individual to community moderators so that they can be banned from the community.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any form of engagement.**  If somebody else engages this type of troll kindly and respectfully tell them to stop.

---

### Spamming
Spamming, or sometimes called [shitposting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shitposting) is a deliberate form of annoyance to aggressively contribute low quality material in high quantities.  A form of maximum effect annoyance from least effort.  They are seeking attention from limited effort.

#### Best Course of Action
If the troll isn't disrupting access to conversations or disrupting the flow of conversation simply ignore them.  If their trolling does disrupt how the community operates ban them.  Either way the goal is to dramatically increase the required effort needed to attain the desired attention.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any form of engagement.**  Any form of engagement will enable their continued assault on the community.

---

### Stalking
Stalking behavior is usually an escalated response from an aggressively determined troll.  An example is when a well minded online citizen properly ignores a troll attack but the troll is dedicated upon seeking the desired attention by following the victim into different conversations or online communities.

#### Best Course of Action
**Report the troll to moderators.**  Once they are done stalking you they will likely pray upon somebody else.  This sort of behavior should be permanently removed from online communities with a permanent ban.  If the given chat application or community has a blocking feature block the stalker so that you are incapable of receiving or viewing their communications.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any response at all.**  The goal is to aggressively illicit your feedback.  Do not give in.  Continue to ignore them at all costs.  If you do crack and respond to the troll they will continue to troll you because they know they can get to you.

---

### Troll Hunter
A troll hunter is somebody who seeks to do battle by calling other people trolls.  This is a specific form of [ad hominem](#ad-hominem) attack that exists for a variety of motivations.  The most common motivation is to police content instead of behavior, much like an echo chamber.  The person demonstrating this behavior could simply be uninformed as to what a troll actually is or could be picking a fight.  It could be that their attack of somebody by the description of troll is entirely valid, but it is still an attack upon a person's character.

#### Best Course of Action
Respond with a link to this document only and terminate all future communication.  The aggressor will likely continue their attacks in an attempt to provoke further responses.  Do not provide any further response.

#### Worst Course of Action
**Any other response.**  Any defense or justification of your position can either be used ammunition for further attacks or can be easily flipped to make you look like the attacker.  Either way they have already beaten you.

---

## Potential Motivations
This following list are some personalities to look out for so that you can identify behaviors to avoid and ignore.

### Arrogance and Entitlement
Some people will believe themselves superior to you and your opinions.  This behavior is most often benign in the form of avoidance or disregard, but can turn into a hostile attack.  Either way a conversation with somebody who has no value for your opinion is a wasted endeavor.

Sometimes this behavior can be manifest upon third parties in a form of argumentation called *appeal to authority*, which is a logical fallacy that says an argument must be more correct if claimed by somebody claimed as an authority figure.  Since a conversation isn't a contest appeals to authority are people just spinning their wheels when they are emotionally invested in a conversation's position but are incapable of providing an otherwise qualified response.  Appeals to authority should be ignored for the baseless hot air that they are.

### Community Vandalism
This is the deliberate act of directly seeking to harming a community or conversation trough disruptive behavior, such as flooding or spamming.

### Competition
Some people view conversations as a form of competition.  This is actually a very common adolescent behavior that most people grow out of.  When a conversation becomes a competition instead of a truth seeking examination the result is a circular spiral of degrading stupidity.  The difference between a conversation and a competition is that a competition has winners and losers while the exchanges in a conversation are potential moments of learning or persuasion for all parties.

### Complaining
In some cases complaining, when properly elaborated upon, can enhance a conversation without distracting from the conversation's subject.  Many times though complaining is a shallow form of dismissive behavior, sometimes exercised as troll baiting.  Other names for this behavior are *bitching* and *crying*.  If commentary in this manner is not described thoroughly enough to try to move a conversation forward it should be immediately ignored as *hurt feelings*.

### Emotional Sponges
Some people thrive on sympathy, victimization, and generalized negativity of non-present third parties.  These are people for whom negative emotion about external factors is always the primary subject of every conversation.  Generally these people are just an annoyance, but they can easily derail an entire conversation.

Common examples includes conversations about any form of new technology and that guy in the corner that always brings up the book *1984*, no matter how irrelevant, or a person that always has to make some abstract subject completely about themselves.  Sometimes this behavior is present because a person is supremely lonely and their loneliness is unintentionally present in their online behavior.  Online interaction is only a placebo as doesn't cure loneliness.

Bear in mind that emotional sponges are vaguely on topic and their behavior is mostly unintentional.  Once their behavior becomes intentional or decisively political they have graduated to [social justice warriors](#social-justice-warriors).

### Fanaticism
Some people have a devout unshifting religious-like faith in a given subject reinforced with deep amounts of emotion and possibly a closed social reference group.  Any attempt to discuss a fanatic's position with a counter-claim is met with war.  A true fanatic is a fairly equal mix of *hurt feelings* and *competition*.

### Fear and Anxiety
Some people have trouble managing real world stresses in a healthy way that may manifest in their online personas.  There are all manner of mental health disorders that can be at cause for this.  Sometimes online conversations dive into subjects that suggest change in the real world or introduce subjects of great emotional insecurity to some people.

A common example of such conversations is elections of national leaders in many nations.  Fear is contagious and is likely the primary factor in the formation of echo chambers.  Fear of change is also the primary reason why rational conversations about climate change often degrade into emotional foolishness, this applies equally to people of any opinion on that subject.

Another common example of fear is a response in a conversation serving as a deliberate warning directed against an opinion opposed to warning against a specified behavior.  These sorts of fear are often linked to *appeals to authority* and *fanatiscm*.  Everybody is entitled to their opinions and may express such opinions in ways that do not violate the behavioral rules of the given community.

### Hurt Feelings
When people get emotional they get irrational. Some forms of trolling aren't immediately obvious (as they could be perceived as stupidity or a savage curiosity) and may trigger retaliation thereby turning a good online citizen into a troll.  Perhaps the best way to avoid trolls is to not become one yourself by ensuring you are not an easy target.

### Intimidation
Some people like to exercise their authority just for the sake of having some authority to exercise.  In this case forced dominance is the goal without any regard for the content of the subject at hand.  Consider these people *online parents*, except the children they are attempting to parent are not theirs to monitor and their behavior is more of an asshole than a loving parent figure.

### Narcissism
Some people are all about themselves, but they may manifest their self-importance in various different ways.  Some people attempt to cultivate a cult-like following through charisma while others may attempt to force their opinion on others with every means available like a blunt hammer.

A true narcissist won't hesitate to lie and cheat to get what they want and view altruism as a pathetic weakness ripe for their manipulation.  A common name for these sorts of people are called *sociopaths*.

### No Impulse Control
Some people are so easily baited into becoming trolls, because they immediately respond without any consideration for the consequences of their words.  While somebody may say something obviously stupid online there is no reason it worthy of a response from anybody.  Let stupid be.

### Rumors and Gossip
Some people find enjoyment from discussing commentary about other people.  That enjoyment is achieved from the act of conversing and not from the substance of the conversation.  That said the quality, accuracy, and validity of the subject matter is often irrelevant.  The most relevant quality is immediate gratification which is primarily achieved by passing along unoriginal thoughts or simply exaggerating a benign circumstance thereby resulting in toxic attacks of third parties.

### Weak Sense of Humor
Sometimes a person may have a poorly developed sense of humor that does not align with that of the larger group resulting in misunderstood behaviors.  Sometimes underdeveloped humor can be related to culture misunderstanding, mental health disorders, or immaturity.  One person's joke can be another person's attack or excessive annoyance.
